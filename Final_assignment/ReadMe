Some points to note about the project:
1. The API keys used in the code given for the GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings and NGROK were the ones generated by me. I am aware that its unsafe to do this, i will change it in a couple of days (I am
currently out of station)
2. The code can be executed on google colab. 
3. The cells can be executed in the given order - first the web scraping, followed by the Langchain segment and then the streamlit file creation.
4. Since the code was written on google colab, I have used ngrok to create the streamlit app.
5. The questions asked will be categorized accordingly and answered as shown in the video demonstration.
